# 👋🏾 Welcome! 👋🏾


I'm a problem-solving oriented, full stack software engineer with a deep interest in website and iOS app development. Currently I am looking for full time work and am open to work on any interesting projects where I can add value!

## About Me:
Lakers must I say anything else! Mamba is the GOAT. If I'm not watching bball I'm watching old gangster movies. 

I have been learning more about app development and would love to start making apps that can educate on iOS and Android devices.
